# Atomic Audio Lib

*A WIP C#/.NET library for parsing, editing, and creating CRI audio formats.*

## Getting Started

TBD.

## Credits

All of the parsing code was heavily based on the good work of several existing libraries:

- [LazyBone152](https://github.com/LazyBone152)'s [XV2-Tools](https://github.com/LazyBone152/XV2-Tools) (License: MIT)
- [Thealexbarney](https://github.com/Thealexbarney)'s [VGAudio](https://github.com/Thealexbarney/VGAudio) (License: MIT)
- [vgmstream](https://github.com/vgmstream)'s [vgmstream](https://github.com/vgmstream/vgmstream) (License: custom)

Finally, none of the binary reading or writing would happen without the `Serialization` library, which is a port of the forthcoming `exbip` Python package â€” both original and port created and generously provided by [Pherakki](https://github.com/Pherakki).
